I promised this file early and I'm sorry for being late.

The GH Pages worked nice so I'm not worried other than having my word questioned.

I forgot this computer didn't had MikTex (and it also had an old Version of RStudio)

It was real late when I realized that. Sorry for inconveniences if any arised.

Anyway, you may check against the other repos to confirm these are all exactly the same file.

PDF might just be a more standard format to share documents in my opinion


Have a good week! And I hope you like my work

=)
